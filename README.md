### Solving Josephus problem using circular, doubly linked list

In Josephus problem, there are n people standing in a circle, of which you are one. Someone outside the circle goes around clockwise and repeatedly eliminates every other person in the circle, until one person — the winner — remains. The objective is to find where should you stand so you become the winner?

In this project, I implement the Josephus circle using a doubly circular linked list (DCLL). First, the winning position is calculated for 41 people in the circle and then it is generalized to 'k' people in the circle
